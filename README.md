Overview

  The backend is built using Node.js and Express.js. It provides RESTful APIs for user authentication, role-based access, and transaction management. The backend is connected to a database (e.g., MongoDB) for storing user and transaction data.

Technologies Used

  Node.js: Runtime environment for executing JavaScript.
  Express.js: Web framework for handling HTTP requests.
  MongoDB: Database for storing user and transaction data.
  Mongoose: ODM for interacting with MongoDB.
  JWT (JSON Web Tokens): For secure authentication.
  Bcrypt: For hashing passwords.
  CORS: To allow cross-origin requests from the frontend.

Installation and Setup

1 Clone the Repository:

  git clone (https://github.com/jai01019/banking-backend)
  cd banking-app/backend

2 Install Dependencies:
   npm install

3 Set Environment Variables:
    Create a .env file in the backend folder and add the following:
    PORT=5000
    MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/banking_app
    JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_key
